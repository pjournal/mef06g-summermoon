# Planes Data Analysis

First of all, I installed packages namely **dplyr**, **nycflights13** as well as **stringr**.

I used **sub** function in **stringr** package to create a driven column, aircraft_type (ac_type).

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(nycflights13)
library(stringr)

options(dplyr.summarise.inform = FALSE)
```

I take a high-level look at planes data which has 3,222 rows and 9 columns. I also have information about what column names are, which data type they have and how their content is in a short notice.

```{r}
planes %>% glimpse()
```

## Create a Dataset

I created a dataset according to manufacturer column. I filtered planes which are manufactured by Airbus, Airbus Industrie and Boeing. I recoded AIRBUS INDUSTRIE as AIRBUS to have a clean dataset.

```{r}
ab_df <- planes %>%
          select(tailnum:engine) %>%
          filter(manufacturer %in% c('AIRBUS', 'AIRBUS INDUSTRIE', 'BOEING')) %>%
          mutate(manufacturer = recode(manufacturer, 'AIRBUS INDUSTRIE' = 'AIRBUS'))
```

## Top 5 Year by Manufacturers

Here is shown top 5 plane count, average number of seats and engines by manufacturer and year. Top 5 years by manufacturers are mostly overlaps. 5th elements in both Boeing and Airbus have the highest change compared to last years respectively.

```{r}
ab_df %>%
  group_by(manufacturer, year) %>%
  summarise(count = n(), avg_seats = mean(seats), avg_engines = mean(engines)) %>%
  mutate(yoy_count = (count-lag(count))/lag(count)*100) %>%
  relocate(yoy_count, .after = count) %>%
  top_n(5, count) %>%
  arrange(manufacturer, desc(count)) %>%
  print(n = Inf)
```

## Aircraft Type Analysis

A new column is created named "ac_type" derived from planes' model. I work in Pegasus currently. As far as I know there is no ac_type starts with "MD" in the fleet. So, I excluded them. As the seat capacity increases, plane count generally decreases independently of manufacturer.

```{r}
ab_df %>%
  mutate(ac_type = sub("\\-.*", "", model)) %>%
  filter(ac_type != "MD") %>%
  group_by(manufacturer, ac_type) %>%
  summarise(count = n(), avg_seats = mean(seats), med_seats = median(seats), avg_engines = mean(engines)) %>%
  arrange(manufacturer, desc(count))
```

## Seat Count Group Analysis

I created 8 bins sized 50. Fleet consists of planes which have seats between 150 and 200 mostly.

```{r}
ab_df %>%
  group_by(seat_group = cut(seats, c(0,50,100,150,200,250,300,350,400,450,500), include.lowest = TRUE)) %>%
  summarise(count = n())
```

## Conclusion

Consequently, I analysed data based on year, aircraft type and seat counts.

1.  Top 5 plane count over years doesn't change much according to manufacturer. Airbus and Boeing have gone hand-in-hand in manufacture-wise over years.

2.  There is a negative relationship between seat capacity and plane count. As the seat capacity increases, plane count decreases and engine count increases. Since maintenance costs are high in aircraft industry, companies may not want to prefer planes that have 4 engines. Therefore, production amount in high-engine sized planes are lower.

3.  Fleet mostly consists of planes which have a seat capacity between 150 and 200. This analysis is aligned with the 2nd one.

**Enjoy reading ! :)**
