## DATA WRANGLING

Before starting EDA, it will be better to prepare the data. We will convert related data to appropriate data types. If we have proper data types, then we can easily use libraries and functions to manipulate the data.

Loading libraries:

```{r,output=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(readxl)
library(lubridate)
library(tidyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(stringi)
library(hrbrthemes)
library(viridis)
library(scales)

options(dplyr.summarise.inform = FALSE)
```

Reading xls file:

```{r}
deals<-read_excel("docs/startup_deals_2021.xlsx")
```

Let's change the column names and look at the summary.

```{r}
deals<-rename(deals,target_company=`Target Company`)
deals<-rename(deals,announcement_date=`Announcement Date`)
deals<-rename(deals,financial_investor=`Financial Investor`)
deals<-rename(deals,investor_origin=`Investor's Origin`)
deals<-rename(deals,stake=`Stake (%)`)
deals<-rename(deals,deal_value=`Deal Value (USD)`)
deals<-rename(deals,investment_stage=`Investment Stage`)
deals<-rename(deals,sector=`Sector`)
deals<-rename(deals,investor=`Investor`)
```

Changing the class of "Announcement Data" column from character to date. Use built-in function -\> "my" function from lubridate library.

```{r}
deals$announcement_date<-my(deals$announcement_date)  
```

Changing the class of "Stake (%)" from character to numeric. First erasing "%" character, dividing by 100 and then converting the numeric.

```{r,warning=FALSE}
deals$stake<-as.numeric(sub("%","",deals$stake))
```

Changing the class of "Deal Value (USD)" from character to numeric.

```{r,warning=FALSE}
deals$deal_value<-as.numeric(deals$deal_value)
```

Let's fix the wrong values in column 'Sector'

```{r}
deals$sector[deals$sector == 'Telecpm'] <- 'Telecom'
deals$sector[deals$sector == 'Cybersec urity'] <- 'Cybersecurity'
deals$sector[deals$sector == 'B lockchain'] <- 'Blockchain'
deals$sector[deals$sector == 'Artificial intelligence'] <- 'Artificial Intelligence'
deals$sector[deals$sector == 'DiÄŸital Comparison'] <- 'Digital Comparison'
deals$sector[deals$sector == 'I mage process'] <- 'Image process'
```

Let's add count values to comma separated values, investor_origin and investor.

```{r}
deals$org_count <- lengths(strsplit(deals$investor_origin, ","))
deals$inv_count <- lengths(strsplit(deals$investor, ","))
```

```{r}
deals <- deals %>% mutate(deal_value = ifelse(is.na(deal_value), 0, deal_value))
```

Let's look at the final types of all columns:

```{r}
glimpse(deals)
```

Dataframes namely "origins" and "investors" are created in order to separate collapsed columns into multiple rows.

```{r}
origins <- deals %>% select(ID, investor_origin)
```

```{r}
origins <- separate_rows(origins, investor_origin, sep = ", ")
```

```{r}
investors <- deals %>% select(ID, investor)
```

```{r}
investors <- separate_rows(investors, investor, sep = ",")
```

## EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)

The chart gives information about how much dollars was invested on start-ups in 2011.

From the pie chart it is clear that the majority of investments are made at acquisition stage with 64%. Later VC Stage, Early VC Stage and Seed Stage follows the first one with 24%, 10% and 2% respectively.

```{r}
df0 <- deals %>% 
       group_by(investment_stage) %>% 
       summarise(count = n(), total_deal = sum(deal_value)) %>%
       mutate(deal_perc = scales::percent(round(total_deal / sum(total_deal), 2)))
```

```{r, warning=FALSE}
df0 %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = "", y = deal_perc, fill= investment_stage)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity", width=1) +
  geom_text(aes(label = deal_perc),
            position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5)) +
  coord_polar("y", start=0) +
  labs(title = "Total Deal(USD) by Investment Stage") +
  xlab("") +
  ylab("")
```

The graph illustrates monthly trends by investment stage. There has been a sharp increase in investments at acquisition stage on August. Investments at Later VC Stage started to grow after March, peaked on June, the downturn began after June. Seed Stage investments have been on the same level over the year. Early VC Stage investments have peaked on June like Later VC Stage investments.

```{r}
df1 <- deals %>% group_by(announcement_date, investment_stage) %>% 
                summarise(total_deal = sum(deal_value))
```

```{r}
df1 %>%
  ggplot( aes(x=announcement_date, y=total_deal)) +
    geom_line( aes(color=investment_stage), color="#69b3a2", size=1.2 )+
    scale_color_viridis(discrete = TRUE) +
    theme(
      legend.position="none",
      plot.title = element_text(size=14),
      panel.grid = element_blank()
    ) +
    scale_x_date(date_breaks="1 month", date_labels="%b") +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=60,vjust=1,hjust=1)) +
    labs(title = "Monthly Deal(USD) by Investment Stage") +
    xlab("Announcement Date") +
    ylab("Deal(USD)") +
    facet_wrap(~investment_stage)
```

The pivot table shows the detailed version of the graph below.

```{r}
df1 %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = investment_stage, values_from = total_deal, values_fill = 0)
```

The chart gives information about how much investment has been made on sectors. Early VC Stage investments have been distributed over many sectors while Later VC Stage investments have been dominated in Delivery&Logistics sector.

```{r}
df2 <- deals %>% filter(investment_stage != "Acquisition") %>%
         group_by(investment_stage, sector) %>%
         summarise(total_deal = sum(deal_value)) %>%
         ungroup() %>%
         top_n(20, total_deal) %>%
         arrange(desc(total_deal))
```

```{r}
df2 %>% ggplot(aes(x = reorder(sector, -total_deal), y = total_deal, fill = investment_stage)) +
        geom_bar(stat = "identity") + 
        theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=60,vjust=1,hjust=1)) +
        labs(title = "Deal(USD) by Sector & Investment Stage") +
        xlab("") +
        ylab("Deal(USD)")
```

Getir has reached the largest deal volume from a variety of investors. Dream Games and Akinon attracted the most investments by deal volume respectively.

```{r}
deals %>% filter(investment_stage != "Acquisition") %>%
         group_by(target_company, sector) %>%
         summarise(total_deal = sum(deal_value), total_inv_count = sum(inv_count)) %>%
         ungroup() %>%
         top_n(10, total_deal) %>%
         arrange(desc(total_deal)) %>%
         print(n = Inf)
```

The graph displays how investor counts change over months as well as point sizes show deal volumes. Investor counts on Seed Stage investments are higher than all other stages. However deal volumes at this stage are lower than the other ones.

```{r}
df3 <- deals %>% group_by(investment_stage, announcement_date) %>%
          summarise(total_inv_cnt = sum(inv_count), total_deal = sum(deal_value))
```

```{r,warning=FALSE}
df3 %>% ggplot(aes(x = announcement_date, y = total_inv_cnt, color = investment_stage)) + 
        geom_point(aes(size = total_deal)) +
        scale_x_date(date_breaks="1 month", date_labels="%b") +
        labs(title = "Monthly Number of Investors by Investment Stage") +
        xlab("Announcement Date") +
        ylab("Number of Investors")
```

The graph displays how countries' investments vary by stages. In Turkey, highest number of deals are made at Seed Stage.

```{r}
df4 <- origins %>% 
  inner_join(deals, by = "ID")
```

```{r}
df5 <- df4 %>% 
        select(investor_origin.x, investment_stage) %>% 
        filter(investor_origin.x != 'NA') %>%
        group_by(investment_stage, investor_origin.x) %>%
        summarise(count = n()) %>%
        arrange(desc(count))
```

```{r}
df5 %>% ggplot(aes(fill = investment_stage, x = investor_origin.x, y = count))  + 
        geom_bar(position="fill", stat = "identity") + 
        theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=90,vjust=1,hjust=1)) +
        labs(title = "Monthly Percentage of Deals by Investment Stage") +
        xlab("Investor Origin") +
        ylab("Percentage of Deals")
```

This pie-chart illustrates top-5 investors by number of deals.

```{r}
df6 <- investors %>% 
        group_by(investor) %>%
        summarise(count = n()) %>%
        arrange(desc(count)) %>%
        ungroup() %>%
        slice_max(count, n = 5)
```

```{r}
df6 %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = 1, y = count, fill= reorder(investor, -count))) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity", width=1) +
  guides(fill = guide_legend(title = "Investor"))+
  coord_polar("y", start=0) +
        labs(title = "Top 5 Investor") +
        xlab("") +
        ylab("")
```
