    "text": "CONCLUSION\n\nWe can see that the first 3 sectors with the most investments, considering the total value, are the E-commerce enabler, Delivery and Logistics and Game sectors. Trendyol and Hepsiburada are the companies that receive the most investment, accounting for 58% of the total investment. The reason for this high rate is that the investment stage of the two companies is “Acquisition”.\nAlthough the largest number of investors is in the gaming sector, the investment amount constitutes about 6% of the total investment amount. The main reason for this is that investment stages are mostly “Seed stages”.\nIf we look at the investments where the investor is only from Turkey, it constitutes 5% of the entire investment rate and mostly constitutes the investment stage as the “Seed Stage”.\nWhen we look at the top 3 companies with the highest number of investors, we see that these are Getir, Dream Games and Akinon. We see that a high percentage of these investors are from outside Turkey.\nWhen we look at the companies that invest in more than one sector, we see that these companies are mostly Turkish companies.\nFinally, although we do not have data from previous years, we think that the pandemic has also affected the sectors invested in in 2021. We see that the E-commerce enabler, Delivery and Logistics sectors have grown significantly with the pandemic."
