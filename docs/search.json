Trendyol and Hepsiburada are the companies that receive the most investment, accounting for 58% of the total investment. The reason for this high rate is that the investment stage of the two companies is “Acquisition”.\nAlthough the largest number of investors is in the gaming sector, the investment amount constitutes about 6% of the total investment amount. The main reason for this is that investment stages are mostly “Seed stages”.\nIf we look at the investments where the investor is only from Turkey, it constitutes 5% of the entire investment rate and mostly constitutes the investment stage as the “Seed Stage”.\nWhen we look at the top 3 companies with the highest number of investors, we see that these are Getir, Dream Games and Akinon. We see that a high percentage of these investors are from outside Turkey.\nWhen we look at the companies that invest in more than one sector, we see that these companies are mostly Turkish companies.\nFinally, although we do not have data from previous years, we think that the pandemic has also affected the sectors invested in in 2021. We see that the E-commerce enabler, Delivery and Logistics sectors have grown significantly with the pandemic."

    "text": "Men participate in the labour force two times more than women. Labour participation and employment rates are aligned. Economic crisis in 2019 had a negative impact on the labour market. COVID reinforced this effect by increasing the unemployment rate.\nIn Doğu Karadeniz, Güneydoğu Anadolu and Ortadoğu Anadolu, gender does not matter for the unemployment. Both men and women are unemployed. Men are more unemployed than women in Kuzeydoğu Anadolu whereas women unemployment rate is higher than that for men in other regions.\nBeing a housewife is the main reason for women that prevents them not being in the labour force. There is a stereotypical gender structure in Turkey that emphasizes on women are house-keepers, men are bread-winners. In addition, discouragement for both men and women overlapped in 2021. People are less motivated to seek for a job in Turkey over years.\nMarital status affects the employment rate for women. Men dominance factor is dramatically higher in married women compared to never married or divorced women. It may have 2 different reasons: Married women are struggling with participating in work life; divorced or never married women need to work to obtain their own economic freedom.\nDivorce rates between provinces are quite different in Turkey. While the top 5 highest divorce rates are in the Mediterranean or West Side, but the lowest 5 are at the East Side of Turkey. When we combine this info with regional unemployment rates, it’s being more dramatic for women.\n\n\n\n\nNon-institutional population: Comprises all the population excluding the residents of dormitories of universities, orphanage, rest homes for elderly persons, special hospitals, prisons and military barracks etc.\n\nNon-institutional working age population: Indicates the population 15 years old and over within the non-institutional civilian population.\n\nLabour force: Labour force covers the working-age population that is willing to supply labour for the production of economic goods and services in the relevant reference period. In determining the labour force, activities that contribute to the production of goods and services within the United Nations System of National Accounts (SNA) production boundary are essential. Labour force comprises all employed and unemployed people. \n\nLabour force participation rate: Indicates the ratio of the labour force to non-institutional working age population.\n\nEmployment: Comprises all the non-institutional working age population who are included in the persons “at work” and “not at work” described below.\nPersons at work: Persons economically active during the reference period for at least one hour as a regular employee, casual employee, employer, self employed or unpaid family worker.\n\nPersons not at work: Regular employee, casual employee, employer, self employed or unpaid family who have a job but away from job during the entire reference week for various reasons are considered as employed, if there is a tie with job according to the absence reason from job.\n\nPersons who are not at work during the reference week due to official holidays or annual leave, sick leave, working hour arrangements, job related training or legal maternity/paternity leave are employed without the need for additional criteria.\n\nPersons who are not at work to raise a child (parental leave, unpaid leave for childcare) are considered as employed only if they have an assurance of return to work within a period of less than 3 months or less and/or they continue to receive job related wage/salary during their absence.\n\nPersons who are not at work because of off-season/low season are considered as employed only if they performing any task or duty during the off-season period.\n\nPersons who are not at work due to the other reasons such as bad weather, there was no work, slowing down or stopping of work for technical or economic reasons, participating a training unrelated to job are considered as employed only if they have an assurance of return to work within a period of 3 months or less.\n\nThe members of producer cooperatives and apprentices or trainees who are working to gain any kind of benefit (income in cash or in kind, social security, traveling cost, pocket money etc.) are considered to be employed.\n\nEmployment Rate: It is the ratio of employment to the non-institutional working age population.\nUnemployment rate: It is the ratio of unemployed persons to the labour force.\n\nReference :\nhttps://data.tuik.gov.tr/Search/Search?text=employment%20rate\n\n\n\nFirst of all, libraries are installed.\n\npti <-

graph shows the labour force participation, employment and unemployment rates by gender over years (2014-2021). Women unemployment rate is higher than men’s unemployment rate whereas  other metrics for women are quite low compared to  those for men. Until 2019, the unemployment rate slightly changes. However, it starts to increase after 2019 due to the economic crisis in Turkey. COVID made the unemployment rate for men and women almost equal. Labour participation and employment rates for men are two times more than those for women. In 2020, labour participation and employment rates are lower compared to other years due to COVID.\n\nlabour_force_status_by_reg %>%\n  filter(region == \"Total\") %>%\n  select(year, gender, labour_force_participation_rate, employment_rate, unemployment_rate) %>%\n   pivot_longer(cols = -c(gender, year), values_to = \"value\", names_to = \"variable\") %>% \n  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = value, fill = reorder(variable, value))) + \n  geom_bar(position=\"dodge\", stat=\"identity\") +\n  facet_grid(. ~ gender) +\n    scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(min(labour_force_status_by_reg$year):max(labour_force_status_by_reg$year))) +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=90,vjust=1,hjust=1), legend.position=\"top\", legend.title=element_blank()) + \n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(title = \"Labour Force Rates by Gender\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis chart displays the distribution of labour force participation by gender over years (2014-2021). Men participate in the labour force more than women independent of region. In addition, the labour force participation rate slightly decreased for all regions in 2010 due to COVID. Regional labour participation rate patterns are quite the same except for Doğu Karadeniz and Güneydoğu Anadolu. Labour force rates for men and women are close in Doğu Karadeniz since women labour force participation rate is higher than other regions. On the contrary, there is a huge gap between men and women in Güneydoğu Anadolu.\n\nlabour_force_status_by_reg %>%\n  filter(region != \"Total\") %>%\n  ggplot() + \n  geom_line(aes(x = year, y = labour_force_participation_rate, color = gender)) + \n  facet_wrap( ~ region) +\n    scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(min(labour_force_status_by_reg$year):max(labour_force_status_by_reg$year))) + \n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=90,vjust=1,hjust=1)) +\n  labs(title = \"Labour Force Participation Rate by Region\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis graph illustrates trends in employment rate between 2014 and 2021.

Unemployment rate for men is higher than that for women in Kuzeydoğu Anadolu. Lines overlap in Doğu Karadeniz, Güneydoğu Anadolu and Ortadoğu Anadolu. There is no distinction between men and women. They are both unemployed. Unemployment rate is low in Batı Karadeniz compared to other regions. Unemployment rate peaked in 2019 generally due to the economic crisis in Turkey.\n\nlabour_force_status_by_reg %>%\n  filter(region != \"Total\") %>%\n  ggplot() + \n  geom_line(aes(x = year, y = unemployment_rate, color = gender)) + \n  facet_wrap( ~ region) +\n    scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(min(labour_force_status_by_reg$year):max(labour_force_status_by_reg$year))) + \n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=90,vjust=1,hjust=1)) +\n  labs(title = \"Unemployment Rate by Region\")\n\n\n\n\nThis boxplot shows us the unemployment rate distribution over years for each region in gender breakdown. \nFirst of all, we may focus on the difference between females and males. Median value of the unemployment rate is higher for females than males in every region.\nThe second objective is that the Marmara region and the west side of Turkey have a lower unemployment rate than other regions. \nThe third objective is about stabilization of the unemployment rate. We can easily see that the Marmara region and the west side of Turkey has more consistent unemployment rates. Especially box plot ranges are maximum in Middle East of Anatolian region, It means that there is no stability over year in this region.\n\nlabour_force_status_by_reg %>%\n  filter(region != \"Total\") %>%\n  ggplot(aes(y=unemployment_rate, group = gender)) + \n  geom_boxplot(fill=\"steelblue\") +\n  facet_grid(gender ~ region) + \n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=90,vjust=1,hjust=1)) +\n  theme(strip.text.x = element_text(size = 3)) +\n  labs(title = \"Unemployment Distribution by Region\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis chart shows trends for not being in the labour force by reasons. Housewife is the main reason that prevents women participation in the labour force. It is not a choice as the name implies. Since women have to take care of housework, they are unemployed whereas men keep working after having children. Education /Training lines overlap. Both men and women care about Education /Training. “Not seeking for a job, available to start - Discouraged” lines are merged in 2021. Due to the economic crisis in Turkey, people are not motivated to find a job. Being disabled, old, ill etc. puts women back in the labour force.\n\nreasons_of_not_being_in_lab_for %>%\n  #filter(gender == \"Female\") %>%\n  group_by(reason,year, gender) %>%\n  summarise(sum_of_not_in_lab_force = sum(pop_not_in_lab_force), .groups = \"drop\") %>%\n  pivot_wider(values_from = sum_of_not_in_lab_force, names_from = gender) %>%\n  transmute(year = year,reason = reason, Female_ = Female/ (Female+Male), Male_ = 1 - Female/ (Female+Male)) %>%\n  pivot_longer(cols= ends_with(\"ale_\"),values_to = \"ratio_not_in_labor_force\", names_to = \"gender\") %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = ratio_not_in_labor_force, color = gender)) +\n  geom_line() + \n  facet_wrap( ~ reason) +\n  theme(strip.text.x = element_text(size = 3)) +\n  labs(title = \"Reasons of not being in labour force by Gender\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of our main aims is understanding the proportion of women in labor in general aspects. We calculated a new metric called employment ratio to detect men vs women participation.  Employment Ratio explains the ratio of Men Employment Rate to Women Employment Rate. It’s a KPI for understanding men’s dominance over women in working life. The graph shows us there is a major difference between married and divorced women in work life. If the marital status is married for both genders, men’s dominance factor is sharply increasing according to never married or divorced people. It may explain 2 different results in terms of 2 different points of view: Married women are struggling with participating work life; divorced or never married women needs to work to obtain their own economic freedom.\n\ndiff<-female%>%mutate(ratio=male$employed_rate/female$employed_rate) %>%select(-gender)\nggplot(diff, aes(x = year, y = ratio, color = marital_status)) + geom_line() +\n    scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(min(female$year):max(female$year))) +\n  labs(title = \"Employment Ratio\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen we inspect the mean age of the mothers in Istanbul province which is the biggest city of Turkey and represent almost 25% of the country’s population, it’s clear that mean age has increased from 28 to 30 in 12 years. There is no spectacular change in any year transition but there is 2 years absolute change in 12 years total.

    "text": "The Civil Code of 1926 gave wider rights to Turkish women in family and social life than in western countries.\nThe Civil Code abolished the regulations on the man’s right to polygamy and unilateral divorce, and gave women the right to divorce, custody and dispose of their property. Thus, women gained an equal status with men in family and social life.\n\nHowever, when it comes to nowadays, we see that the dominance of men in labor force. Considering the data provided by TUIK, we can observe several cases.\n\n\n\nMen are two times more than women in labour market. This ratio does not change much even though more women participate in labour force over years.\nLabour Force and Employement Ratios has a decreasing trend until COVID. However, pandemics is big game changer. It has a negative effect on labour force figures. So, trend of ratios increased in 2020. 2021 is a recovery year for employment figures after pandemics.\nMarital status is a game changer in labour force especially for women. Labour force participation increases much more for divorced women compared to divorced men. Women need to work to manage her life after divorce. Thanks to economic freedom, women are no longer trapped in unhappy marriages.\nReasons of not being a part of labour force indicates a stereotypical structure for gender roles in Turkey. Taking care of home is accepted as women’s job whereas men are bread-winners in this scenario. Therefore, being housewife prevent women participating in labour workforce. Retirement and Education are the most voted reason for men. Men’s reasons are arbitrary. However, women has no other choice other than taking care of home.\nSeaside provinces have a higher divorce rate than Eastern Regions.\n\n\n\n\nIn this project, Population & Demographics domain in TUIK Dataset will be studied. Main focus of analysis is to explore why females are hired less with respect to males. It is quite hard to solve this issue in a sudden. Since, its roots go very deeply. However, we hope to create an awareness through this project.\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\npti <- c(\"readxl\",\"dplyr\",\"tidyverse\", \"ggplot2\", \"lubridate\", \"tidyr\", \"stringi\", \"hrbrthemes\", \"viridis\", \"scales\", \"knitr\")\npti <- pti[!(pti %in% installed.packages())]\nif(length(pti)>0){\n  install.packages(pti)\n}\n\nlibrary(readxl)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(lubridate)\nlibrary(tidyr)\nlibrary(stringi)\nlibrary(hrbrthemes)\nlibrary(viridis)\nlibrary(scales)\nlibrary(knitr)\n\n\n\n\nCode\nlabour_force_status_by_reg <- readRDS(\"docs/tuik/Labour_force_status_by_reg.rds\")\n\nemployed_rate_by_marital_status <- readRDS(\"docs/tuik/Employed_rate_by_marital_status.rds\")\n\nreasons_of_not_being_in_lab_for <- readRDS(\"docs/tuik/Reasons_of_not_being_in_lab_for.rds\")\n\ncrude_divorce_rate_by_provinces <- readRDS(\"docs/tuik/Crude_divorce_rate_by_provinces.rds\")\n\n\n\n\nWhen we look at the change in rate of women participation rate in labour force, we cannot observe a significant change. Average increase in growth in women labor participation is almost as same as growth in men participation.\n\n\nCode\ndf1 <- labour_force_status_by_reg %>% \n  filter(region == \"Total\") %>%\n  select(year, gender, labour_force_participation_rate, unemployment_rate, employment_rate)\n\ndf2 <- employed_rate_by_marital_status %>%\n  filter(marital_status == \"Divorced\") %>%\n  select(year, gender, divorced_emp_rate = employed_rate)\n\ndf3 <- df1 %>% \n  inner_join(df2, by = c(\"year\", \"gender\"))\n\n\n\n\nCode\ndf3 %>% \n  ggplot() + \n  geom_line(aes(x = year, y = labour_force_participation_rate, colour = \"red\")) + \n  geom_line(aes(x = year, y = employment_rate, colour = \"blue\")) + \n  scale_color_identity(name = '',\n                       breaks = c('red', 'blue'),\n                       labels = c(\"LF Participation Rate\", \"Employment Rate\"),\n                       guide = 'legend') +\n  theme(legend.position = \"top\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(min(df3$year):max(df3$year))) + \n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=90,vjust=1,hjust=1)) + \n  facet_wrap( ~ gender) +\n  ylab(\"\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLabour force participation and employment rates for men are two times more than women. So, we divide men’s figures by women and observe these ratios on an annual trend graph. Women labour force increases by years. Therefore, ratios decrease until 2019. However, ratios began to increase in 2020 since labour force decreased especially for men due to COVID. Ratios keep decreasing after COVID. So, it shows that employment figures catch up with prior trend before 2020.\n\n\nCode\ndf4 <- df3 %>% \n  select(year, gender, labour_force_participation_rate) %>%\n  pivot_wider(names_from = gender, values_from =  labour_force_participation_rate) %>%\n  mutate(lfp_ratio = Male / Female) %>%\n  select(year, lfp_ratio)\n\ndf5 <- df3 %>% \n  select(year, gender, employment_rate) %>%\n  pivot_wider(names_from = gender, values_from =  employment_rate) %>%\n  mutate(emp_ratio = Male / Female) %>%\n  select(year, emp_ratio)\n\ndf4 %>% \n  inner_join(df5, by = \"year\") %>%\n  ggplot() +\n  geom_line(aes(x = year, y = lfp_ratio, colour = \"green\")) +\n  geom_line(aes(x = year, y = emp_ratio, colour = \"blue\")) + \n  scale_color_identity(name = '',\n                       breaks = c('green', 'blue'),\n                       labels = c(\"LF Participation Ratio\", \"Employment Ratio\"),\n                       guide = 'legend') +\n  theme(legend.position = \"top\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(min(df5$year):max(df5$year))) +\n  ylab(\"\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeing divorce is an important factor for women that increases employment rate dramatically. Economic freedom of women makes divorcement much more easier compared to prior years. Employed women have more power to abandon unhappy marriages. This graph also emphasizes on the stereotypical gender roles in Turkey. Being divorced almost has no effect on labour force of men whereas women experience a life changing event.\n\n\nCode\ndf3 %>%\n  ggplot() +\n  geom_line(aes(x = year, y = employment_rate, colour = \"blue\")) +\n  geom_line(aes(x = year, y = divorced_emp_rate, colour = \"deeppink1\"))  + \n  scale_color_identity(name = '',\n                       breaks = c('blue', 'deeppink1'),\n                       labels = c(\"Employment Rate\", \"Divorced Employment Rate\"),\n                       guide = 'legend') +\n  theme(legend.position = \"top\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(min(df3$year):max(df3$year))) + \n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=90,vjust=1,hjust=1)) +\n  facet_wrap( ~ gender) +\n  ylab(\"\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe observed that women labor participation rate is not increasing. Then, we observed that women has more variability in unemployment compared to men unemployment. This case is also not good for women situation in Turkey.\nFollowing diagram is formed by dividing men employment rate to women employment rate. It is acceptable that the ratio will be positive and above 1. Men are more employed than women are. However, it is interesting that when someone is married or widowed, the gender plays an important role. Vice versa, when someone is never married or divorced, the gender does not play an important role as it plays in the other scenario.\n\n\nCode\nfemale<-employed_rate_by_marital_status%>%filter(gender==\"Female\")\nmale<-employed_rate_by_marital_status%>%filter(gender==\"Male\")\n\ndiff<-female%>%mutate(ratio=male$employed_rate/female$employed_rate) %>%select(-gender)\nggplot(diff, aes(x = year, y = ratio, color = marital_status)) + geom_line() +\n    scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(min(female$year):max(female$year))) +\n  labs(title = \"Employment Ratio\")\n\n\n\n\n\nWe think this situation is caused from having a child in the family. Either you are divorced or married; you have a high probability that you have a child. When a woman have a child, most probably, she will leave employment status.\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, we have another issue in addition to participation rate. When we observe the employment rate, we can see that variability in women unemployment rate. In the following diagram, red lines that represent women have higher variability in slopes of the lines. Red lines look like saw tooth but blue lines representing men are more in a straight-line form. (Except Kuzeydoğu Anadolu).\n\n\nCode\nlabour_force_status_by_reg %>%\n  filter(region != \"Total\") %>%\n  ggplot() + \n  geom_line(aes(x = year, y = unemployment_rate, color = gender)) + \n  facet_wrap( ~ region) +\n    scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(min(labour_force_status_by_reg$year):max(labour_force_status_by_reg$year))) + \n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=90,vjust=1,hjust=1)) +\n  labs(title = \"Unemployment Rate by Region\") +\n  ylab(\"unemployment rate\")\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can this situation in another representation. In the following graph, we see that boxes for women unemployment rate has a longer height compared to boxes representing men unemployment rate.\nThe exception of Kuzeydoğu Anadolu is also valid because the following graph is also derived from the same data. Except Kuzeydoğu Anadolu, variability of women unemployment rate is higher; represented by more longer/stretched boxes. \n\n\nCode\nlabour_force_status_by_reg %>%\n  filter(region != \"Total\") %>%\n  ggplot(aes(y=unemployment_rate, group = gender)) + \n  geom_boxplot(fill=\"steelblue\") +\n  facet_grid(gender ~ region) + \n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=90,vjust=1,hjust=1)) +\n  theme(strip.text.x = element_text(size = 3)) +\n  labs(title = \"Unemployment Distribution by Region\") +\n  ylab(\"unemployment rate\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen we analyze the reasons of not being in labour force for both genders, we see that the biggest reason for women is undertaking the housework. In fact, we see that this ratio for housework for men is “0”. (We can think that the biggest reason for this is the policies implemented by the state and cultural factors.)\nAlso, we can see that retirement is an important reason for men. this may indicate that employers do not prefer to employ retired men, or that retired men no longer prefer to work.\n\n\nCode\ndf6 <- reasons_of_not_being_in_lab_for %>%\n  group_by(gender, reason) %>%\n  summarise(pop_not_in_lab_force = sum(pop_not_in_lab_force), .groups = \"drop\")\n\ndf7 <- df6 %>% \n  filter(reason == \"Total\") %>%\n  select(gender, total_pop_not_in_lab_force = pop_not_in_lab_force)\n\ndf8 <- df6 %>% \n  filter(reason != \"Total\")\n\ndf9 <- df7 %>%\n  inner_join(df8, by = \"gender\") %>%\n  mutate(pop_not_in_lab_force_rate = pop_not_in_lab_force / total_pop_not_in_lab_force) %>%\n  select(gender, reason, pop_not_in_lab_force_rate)\n\ndf9 %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = \"\", y = pop_not_in_lab_force_rate, fill = reason )) +\n  geom_bar(width = 1, stat = \"identity\") +\n  coord_polar(\"y\", start=0) +\n  geom_text(aes(label = scales::percent(round(pop_not_in_lab_force_rate,2))),\n            position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5), size = 2, angle = -80) +\n  facet_wrap( ~ gender) +\n  xlab(\"\") +\n  ylab(\"\") +\n  theme_void() +\n  theme(legend.text=element_text(size=4), legend.position = \"bottom\", legend.title=element_blank())\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso, if we look at the effects of divorces on women’s employment in 2012-2021, we see that the most divorces in women are in the Aegean region, and the least in the Southeastern Anatolia region.\nIt seems that the employment rate difference of women and men, is similar to the divorce rate in these regions.\nIn other words, we can think that divorce in women increases labor force participation. We can also say that women have to work after divorce.\n\n\nCode\nplot_data1<-crude_divorce_rate_by_provinces %>% \n       group_by(province) %>% \n       summarise(avg_rate = mean(crude_divorce_rate))%>% \n       arrange(desc(avg_rate)) %>%\n       top_n(5)\n\nggplot(plot_data1,aes(x=reorder(province, -avg_rate), y=avg_rate, fill= province)) + \n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n  labs(title = \"Top 5 provinces for the average divorce rate\") +\n  xlab(\"province\") +\n  ylab(\"average divorce rate\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nplot_data2<-crude_divorce_rate_by_provinces %>% \n       group_by(province) %>% \n       summarise(avg_rate = mean(crude_divorce_rate))%>% \n       arrange(avg_rate) %>%\n       slice(1:5) \n\nggplot(plot_data2,aes(x=reorder(province, -avg_rate), y=avg_rate, fill=province)) + \n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n  labs(title = \"Top 5 provinces for the lowest average divorce rate\") +\n  xlab(\"province\") +\n  ylab(\"average divorce rate\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to analysis below, the roots of employment go deep to how Turkish society understands family and is also a political issue. Therefore, it is not easy to close the gap.\nIn order not to reinforce stereotype that housework is only women’s job:\n\nThe perception against jobs classified by gender should be changed. There is no such thing like women’s or men’s job.\nWomen should be more in positions of power to change the culture radically.\nPosition of gender monitor should be established to make sure public programs are aligned with country’s goals of gender equality.\nMaternity leave should be extended to paternity leave so men should take active role in childcare and be equal with women when they have a child.\nGovernment should provide affordable or free childcare centers so parents could leave their children comfortably when they go to work.\n\nWe hope that people who read this report will have an awareness about the subject. We can take small steps by making research on how employment policies against women are conducted in our business environment.\n“This is one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind.” Neil Armstrong\n\n\n\nShiny App Link is here.\n\n\nCode\nshiny::runGitHub(repo = \"pjournal/mef06g-summermoon\",subdir=\"docs/tuik\")\n\n\n\n\n\nhttps://ilostat.ilo.org/resources/concepts-and-definitions/description-labour-force-statistics/\nhttps://www.ilo.org/infostories/en-GB/Stories/Employment/barriers-women#intro\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hP8dLUxBfsU"
